# DateScience-Titanic
My participation in the Titanic-Challange from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).It is about predicting who survived the titanic disaster.

# data preparation
I replaced missing data in features Fare, Embarked and Age. Furthermore, I used categorical encoding for Sex and dummy encoding for Embarked.

# Algorithms used
I have used KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic Regression. I tried a lot of combinations of different features. For example, with KNN I used every combination of 1, 2 and 3 features. The best result on the kaggle plattform was 0.7655 accuracy.
